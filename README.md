## Problem Domain:
Digital logic, verilog, and the use of FPGA’s can become very difficult for beginners to enter. It is often characterized by dry syntax, complex timing constraints, and abstract hardware concepts that can scare away beginner learners. We selected this domain because there’s a critical need to bridge the gap between "coding" (software) and "engineering" (hardware) for early students. By gamifying the learning process, we transform Verilog from a tedious hardware description language into a "magic spell" that controls physical inputs and outputs, making the learning curve significantly less steep and far more rewarding and enjoyable.

We’re a team of ECE students with a strong background in Generative AI for Chip Design, with a passion to make learning enjoyable for all ages. It doesn’t matter where you start, what matters is learning to use powerful tools that can make your imagination come alive.

## Proposed Innovation:

Our innovation "Vericade”, a Logic Lab Arcade, is an educational hardware platform designed to teach and explain Verilog and FPGA architecture for young and old students through gamification. Traditional hardware design is often abstract and intimidating; we bridge this gap by transforming the FPGA board into a build-it-yourself gaming console. The curriculum features four progressive modules:

+ Binary Adder: A calculator teaching arithmetic logic and binary representation.
+ LED Maze: A navigation game introducing I/O mapping and combinational logic.
+ Tic-Tac-Toe: A classic strategy game used to teach Finite State Machines (FSMs).
+ Connect Four: A capstone project involving complex arrays and sequential logic.

By wrapping dry engineering concepts in familiar game mechanics, students won’t just write code; they’ll engineer fun, tangible interactions.

To accelerate development, we will utilize Generative AI for RTL and Testbench Generation using Cognichip features and tools. This will create comprehensive SystemVerilog testbenches that cover every edge case, like an Ai-auto-grader.

We will test the system through simulation-based verification using AI-generated vectors, followed by on-board testing to ensure real-time responsiveness.
